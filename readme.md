Firework is a lightweight, compiled, statically typed imperative programming language. The code written in firework is directly compiled to C, then into bytecode.

I wrote this thing because my university course asked me to write a compiler in Haskell and I despised it, so I'll do it in C instead(After the course is over of course).

I have no idea how to write markdown (yet).
